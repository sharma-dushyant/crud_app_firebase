#CRUD :  create, read, update, and delete

This project is a **Flutter-based CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application, integrated with **Firebase Cloud Firestore** to manage user credentials. The app enables users to interact with their credentials stored on Firebase or a local database, providing a seamless experience for data management.

### **Key Features:** 🛠️
- **Create** ✍️: Add new user credentials (name, email, password) to Firebase or a local database.
- **Read** 👀: Retrieve and display stored credentials in a user-friendly format using **ListView**.
- **Update** ✏️: Modify existing user credentials, offering the ability to update user information easily.
- **Delete** 🗑️: Enable users to delete their credentials from the database, providing complete data management.

### **Technologies Used:** 💻
- **Flutter**: For building cross-platform mobile applications.
- **Firebase Firestore**: For storing user credentials and data in the cloud.
- **Dart**: Used to implement app logic and functionality.
- **Firebase Authentication** (optional) 🔒: For managing user login and security.

### **How It Works:** ⚙️
1. **Adding Credentials** ✍️: Users can input their name, email, and password to add new credentials.
2. **Viewing Credentials** 📜: A list of stored credentials is displayed in a **ListView**, with details like name, email, and password.
3. **Editing Credentials** 🖊️: Users can edit and update any stored credentials with ease.
4. **Deleting Credentials** 🗑️: Users can remove credentials when no longer needed, ensuring easy data management.

### **Why This Project?** 💡
This app provides a practical demonstration of how to work with **Firebase Cloud Firestore** and **Flutter**, allowing you to create functional mobile applications. It showcases data management techniques such as **CRUD operations** and highlights the integration of backend services like **Firebase** with a front-end mobile application.
